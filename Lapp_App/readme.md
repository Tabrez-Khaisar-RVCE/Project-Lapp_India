# Frontend
## Introduction
This repository contains all the front end files. This includes the finalised design and the current progress towards building the front end. If you do not see any significant changes, this is because the code is currently being developed and has not been added yet. The repository in which we are running experimental features is not included in this frontend repository, because it will not be used in the code in its current state. Once the experimental features are refined only then will it be added.

Please refer to the projects tab to see the progress of the frontend. [App-FrontEnd-Design](https://github.com/ShirishKumar-lapp/Intern-Lapp-App/projects/4) and [App-FrontEnd-Code](https://github.com/ShirishKumar-lapp/Intern-Lapp-App/projects/1) explains the progress made towards the UI design of the app and the progress towards actualising the design through code respectively.

## Tools used details
1. Figma
2. Kivymd

### 1. Figma
Figma is a design tool, that was used to make the app design. This helps in visualisation and implementation of the apps. This includes types of layouts, size of boxes
and position of each tool according to pixel measurments.

Apart from this we used Dribble as a source of inspiration for our UI design. We also used Freepik[^1] for the login page background (We have attached the source that was used as per our legal obligations).

### 2. Kivymd
Kivymd uses the MIT License. This license allows users to use Kivymd for commercial purposes without any cost.
- It is a native python GUI. So all code written through Kivymd in python will be in the python format.
- It has a design file, the code within the design file is written in the kivy syntax. This syntax is similar to css syntax.
- It has a fast bootup time after the first startup. Since it deploys cache on the users laptop, during the first startup.
